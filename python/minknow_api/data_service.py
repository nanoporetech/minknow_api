    def get_channel_states(self, _message=None, _timeout=None, **kwargs):
        """Get the channel states for all channels from the device.

        This will return all the channel states from the moment of calling until the rpc is
        closed by the user. If the user stops acquisition, the rpc will return with the
        ABORTED status. If the user cancels the rpc, the status will be CANCELLED.

        The first messages returned will retrieve the current channel state for all channels
        On the MinION, the current state for all channels will be included in the first message.
        For PromethION, it will be split on multiple messages.

        To determine which channels have been returned, please check the channel member in the
        messages returned in the response.

        The response will be streamed, and we will provide a message as soon as there are channel
        state changes (though note that some channels could stay in the same state for a long time),
        so there is no guaranteed frequency of the messages returned. However, because a response
        message includes multiple channels, it is very likely that we have messages every few seconds.
        As in, it is likely that at least some of the channels will change every so often, therefore
        messages will be generated. For example, if 5 out of 512 channels change the state in the
        same time, there will be a message containing all 5 changes. Later on, if other channels
        change their state we will receive another message containing those and so on. Note that
        MinKNOW tries to group as many channel state changes in a single message, up to the message
        limit size, which is currently set to 32kB.

        This RPC has no side effects. Calling it will have no effect on the state of the
        system. It is safe to call repeatedly, or to retry on failure, although there is no
        guarantee it will return the same information each time.

        Args:
            _message (minknow_api.data_pb2.GetChannelStatesRequest, optional): The message to send.
                This can be passed instead of the keyword arguments.
            _timeout (float, optional): The call will be cancelled after this number of seconds
                if it has not been completed.
                Note that this is the time until the call ends, not the time between returned
                messages.
            first_channel (int): The first channel (inclusive) to return data for.

                Note that channel numbering starts at 1.
            last_channel (int): The last channel (inclusive) to return data for.

                Note that channel numbering starts at 1.
            use_channel_states_ids (google.protobuf.wrappers_pb2.BoolValue, optional): If this is true, the returned messages will contain the
                channel state id as opposed to the name. By default,
                the response will contain channel states names.
            wait_for_processing (bool, optional): If `wait_for_processing` is true, then get_channel_states will wait until minknow starts
                acquiring data instead of returning with an error

                Defaults to false
            heartbeat (google.protobuf.duration_pb2.Duration, optional): Ensure the stream sends a message at least this often.

                There will usually be multiple channel updates a second, but in some circumstances (eg: a
                flow cell with no sample loaded) there can be long periods of time without updates.

                Setting this value will ensure that if this period of time passes without there being any
                channel state changes to report, an empty message will be sent. This can be useful to force a
                minimum wakeup interval in the client code.

        Returns:
            iter of minknow_api.data_pb2.GetChannelStatesResponse

        Note that the returned messages are actually wrapped in a type that collapses
        submessages for fields marked with ``[rpc_unwrap]``.

        This can be used to sample the signal being produced by the device. The signal can be
        returned as raw ADC values or as calibrated picoamp (pA) values; see ``set_calibration`` on
        the device service for the values used in this conversion.

        In addition to the signal, this can return the associated channel configuration and/or bias
        voltage information, to help analyse the data.

        If bias voltage information is requested, one bias voltage sample will be provided for each
        signal sample (on any given channel). So if you request 20 samples of signal data and also
        bias voltages, you will get 20 signal samples on each channel and also 20 bias voltage
        samples. Bias voltages are always given in millivolts, and no corrections need to be applied
        (for example, the 5x amplifier on a MinION is already accounted for).

        If channel configuration information is requested, each channel will have the starting
        channel configuration (with offset 0 to indicate it applies to the first sample on that
        channel), as well as any configuration changes that affect any of the returned samples.

        If a device settings change RPC has completed before this method is called, the data returned
        is guaranteed to have been generated by the device after those settings were applied.
        However, note that no guarantee is made about how device settings changes that overlap with
        this request will affect the returned data.

        The response will be streamed. In order to limit the size of each response message, any given
        message may include data from only a subset of the requested channels.

        Note that the data is returned as bytes fields. See the GetSignalBytesResponse documentation
        for more details about how to interpret the value. In Python code, the minknow.Device class

            samples (int, optional): The amount of data to return in samples.

        This call is blocking - it will return from the rpc when it would have processed the

        it will exit with the ABORTED status. This can happen if the analyser is more than 1 minute behind

        exited with the ABORT status, another RPC can immediately be started. The failed RPC would have not
